				<h2>Processor Design</h2>
				<p>A 32-bit Two-Cycle Processor</p>
			</header>

			<p>The processor has a 2-stage pipeline:</p>

			<li><b>Instruction Fetch</b>: Instruction is fetched from instruction memory.</li>
			<li><b>Execute</b>: The instruction is decoded, executed, and committed (written back). This is a combination of the remaining stages of a normal MIPS pipeline.</li>

			<p>With that two-cycle pipline, the processor implements the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) using a two-cycle pipeline. It contains an instance Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Data Memory, and Register File with the entire datapath and control.</p>
			
			<div class="image project"><img src="../images/cpu-design.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			
			<p>The processor gets its program from the processor harness provided in a run file. It send the address of instruction memory it wants to access to the harness through an output, and accept the instruction at that address as an input.
